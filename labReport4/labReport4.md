# Lab Report 3


[MarkdownParse repo](https://github.com/ravishende/markdown-parser)

[MarkdownParse repo from previous week](https://github.com/ravishende/markdown-parser)
*note: I had covid week 7 and therefore could not participate in that lab or do it remotely due to its inherant group nature. So, I am using a version of the markdownParser from week 8 as the other group's mdp instead.
