### Streamlining ssh Configuration

First, I created and then put in the code for my config file, using:
 `touch` to create the file, `vim` to edit the new file, and `cat` to show it.

Here's the file with adding the code with `vim`

Here's the commands run to modify the file and then show that it is saved with the modification

So, with that config file setup, we can now run the following command:

And then, as you can see, it does the ssh over to the ieng6 server without having to type out the entire username.
